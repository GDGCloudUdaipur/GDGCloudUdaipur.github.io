        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: May 7, 2025</p>

        <p>This Refund Policy applies to any paid events, workshops, or services (collectively "Paid Services") offered by Google Developer Group (GDG) Cloud Udaipur. For free events, this policy is not applicable.</p>

        <h2>1. Event Tickets (e.g., Cloud Community Days)</h2>
        <p>For Paid Services such as tickets to "Cloud Community Days - Early Bird: â‚¹200" or other ticketed workshops:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cancellation by Attendee & Full Refund:</strong> A full refund of the ticket price will be issued if a cancellation request is made in writing (e.g., via email to abhinav.jain1411@gmail.com) at least <strong>7 (seven) calendar days</strong> before the scheduled start date of the event.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation by Attendee & Partial Refund/Credit:</strong> If a cancellation request is received in writing less than 7 calendar days but more than <strong>48 hours</strong> before the scheduled start time of the event, a <strong>50% refund</strong> of the ticket price may be offered. Alternatively, at the sole discretion of the GDG Cloud Udaipur organizers, a credit for the full ticket amount towards a future GDG Cloud Udaipur event may be offered.</li>
            <li><strong>Cancellation by Attendee & No Refund:</strong> No refunds or credits will be issued for cancellation requests received less than 48 hours before the scheduled start time of the event, or for attendees who do not show up to the event ("no-shows") without prior written cancellation as per the timelines above.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer of Tickets:</strong> In some cases, tickets may be transferable to another individual if requested in writing at least 48 hours before the event. This is subject to approval by the GDG Cloud Udaipur organizers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Event Cancellation or Postponement by GDG Cloud Udaipur</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Refund:</strong> If GDG Cloud Udaipur cancels a Paid Service entirely, registered attendees who have paid will receive a full refund of the ticket price paid.</li>
            <li><strong>Postponement:</strong> If GDG Cloud Udaipur postpones a Paid Service, attendees will be notified of the new date. Tickets will automatically be valid for the rescheduled date. If an attendee is unable to attend on the new date, they may request a full refund, provided the request is made in writing within 7 calendar days of the postponement announcement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Membership Fees (If Applicable)</h2>
        <p>If GDG Cloud Udaipur introduces a paid membership model in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Membership fees are generally <strong>non-refundable</strong> once processed, as they may grant immediate access to member benefits, exclusive content, or community platforms.</li>
            <li>Specific refund conditions or cooling-off periods for memberships, if any, will be clearly outlined at the time of membership purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Process for Requesting a Refund</h2>
        <p>To request a refund based on the conditions outlined above, please send an email to <strong>abhinav.jain1411@gmail.com</strong>. Your email must include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your full name (as used during registration)</li>
            <li>The email address used for registration</li>
            <li>The name and date of the event/service for which you are requesting a refund</li>
            <li>Proof of payment (e.g., transaction ID, payment confirmation screenshot)</li>
            <li>A clear reason for the cancellation/refund request.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Refunds, where applicable, will be processed to the original method of payment (wherever feasible) within <strong>7-14 business days</strong> after the refund request has been approved by the GDG Cloud Udaipur organizers.</p>

        <h2>5. Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>GDG Cloud Udaipur reserves the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our official communication channels, and the "last updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised. For existing registrations, the policy in effect at the time of registration will generally apply, unless changes are necessitated by unforeseen circumstances or are to the benefit of the attendee.</p>
