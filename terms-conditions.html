        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: May 7, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Frazor Enterprise Solutions LLP. These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for participation in our GDG Cloud Udaipur events, use of our online platforms (including any website we may operate, social media channels, and communication groups), and engagement with our community (collectively, the "Service").</p>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access or participate in the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>Your participation in any GDG Cloud Udaipur event or use of its online resources constitutes your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to update these terms at any time, and will make reasonable efforts to communicate significant changes.</p>

        <h2>2. Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and participants in GDG Cloud Udaipur activities are required to adhere to the Google Developer Groups Code of Conduct. This is essential for fostering a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone.</p>
        <p>Key principles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Respectful:</strong> Value each other's ideas, styles, and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Inclusive:</strong> Seek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and people powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>No Harassment:</strong> We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments, sexual language and imagery in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from the event or platform (without refund if applicable), or reporting to local law enforcement.</p>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the GDG Cloud Udaipur organizing team immediately.</p>

        <h2>3. Event Participation</h2>

By attending an event, you consent to such recording and its release, publication, exhibition, or reproduction to be used for news, webcasts, promotional purposes, telecasts, advertising, inclusion on websites, social media, or any other purpose by GDG Cloud Udaipur and its affiliates and representatives. You release GDG Cloud Udaipur, its organizers, and each and all persons involved from any liability connected with the taking, recording, digitizing, or publication and use of interviews, photographs, computer images, video and/or sound recordings.</li>

If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
